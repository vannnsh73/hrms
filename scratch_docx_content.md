1. Document Overview

1.1 Purpose

This Product Specification Document (PSD) defines the functional scope, user roles, modules, and detailed user stories for WorkFlow, a Global Human Resource Management System (HRMS) delivered as a mobile-first web application. It serves as the single source of truth for product, design, engineering, and QA stakeholders during planning and implementation.

1.2 Product Summary

WorkFlow is a comprehensive, role-aware HRMS that centralizes the entire employee lifecycle, from pre-joining onboarding through attendance, leave, payroll, expenses, performance, learning, recognition, recruitment, and people analytics. The application supports four distinct roles, an embedded AI HR Copilot, and is designed for multi-country operations (initially the United States and India) with localized payroll and compliance handling.

1.3 Scope

The current release covers the modules listed in Section 4. Data is currently served from a mock data layer for demonstration; production deployment is expected to connect these modules to a backend database, authentication provider, and notification services.
